          <p>Keep up to date with the foods that are in season. It's handy to know for when you are planning a meal in advance, or if you are considering submitting a request to the Kitchen Manager. Here are some links to charts detailing the seasonality of common fruits and vegetables.</p>

          <p><h3>Kitchen Guidelines</h3></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean up after yourself! Just because there's a kitchen clean shift, doesn't mean you shouldn't handle the mess you made making that vegan double shot espresso gluten-free stir-fry</li>
            <li>Always check to see if there's an open container of what you're looking for thoroughly before opening a new one.  Odds are, there's one laying around somewhere</li>
            <li>Refrigerated items need to go back into the fridge! Don't be the person who makes us throw away a whole block of sweet, sweet white cheddar</li>
            <li>Always cook meat on the <b class="text-error">red</b> cutting boards.  Those are reserved specifically for cooking non-vegetarian foods</li>
            <li>If you are seeking a cook shift, you should know the allergies of your housemates and plan your dishes accordingly</li>
