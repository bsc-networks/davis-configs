          </p>
          <p>
            Davis House has it's own file server running FreeNAS, a variant of FreeBSD tailored towards file sharing services. We have lots and lots of storage for whatever content that the residents of this home decide to upload.  Anyone can read the contents of our file server.  Anonymous/Guest access is totally permitted.  However, an account is required to modify the contents of our file server.  This means that you need a login and password in order to add any content.  You may be wondering, <i>"Why the hell do I need to login to give other people my favorite Nicki Minaj album?".</i> Well, without requiring an account to modify the files, anyone on our network could have their way with our files.  It would only take one Rambo individual to delete the entirety of our files.  Therefore, user credentials are required to get write permissions to the server.  To get an account, talk to your Network Manager.  He/She will set house residents up with accounts.
