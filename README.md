Davis House Router Configuration
===========

Stored here is the Chef repository that manages Davis House Cooperative's servers.

The Chef server is a Hosted Enterprise Chef solution, which is great because it's free for under 5 machines :)

TODO
- Write documentation for carrying out common tasks through Chef
- Find out how to 'Chefify' the FreeNAS server. Alternatively, move the FreeNAS server to a different OS
